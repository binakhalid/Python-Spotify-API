"# Python-Spotify-API" 

Used Python to retrieve two public playlists by using the Spotify API.

Created one list from the track names that are in both playlists and one list that contains distinct list of all track names.
Print the lists.
Use your own Client ID and Client Secret.
Used a wrapper library for Spotify in Python called SPOTIPY
